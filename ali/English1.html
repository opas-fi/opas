hi I'm Laura to assist and you are

watching engineering made easy

scientists have found proof of God in

the code of DNA but what did the found

in the DNA code that made them believe

in the existence of God keep watching

the video to get the answer as you know

that a computer program is a series of

binary numbers that is once and zeros

this sequence of ones and zeros

instructs the computer watch to do in

the same way all the functions that are

taking place inside the cell of the body

are controlled by an incredibly complex

and extremely long code written in the

DNA which is placed inside the nucleus

of all the cells of our body but now the

cushion arises how this complex code of

DNA convinced scientists of the presence

of God let's try to understand it with

the help of a simple example suppose you

are walking on a beach and suddenly you

see a message written on the beach send

the message is Michael is my best friend

then what is the possibility that this

message was just written by chance by

the random waves you will say no it's

not possible how these waves of the

ocean can write this message this

message is an information that must have

come from the intelligence so it is not

possible for us to neglect an

intelligent mind behind such a simple

meaningful message carrying information

so the point is information comes from

intelligence according to dr. Francis

Collins director of the human genome

project one can think of DNA as an

instructional script is software program

sitting in the nucleus of the cell now

if we see the complexity of the code

written in the DNA it will boggle your

mind the letters of the programming

language written in the DNA are a P G

and C just like the letters of computer

programming language ones and zeroes as

what the computer

will do is decided by the program placed

inside it some memory that maybe

hundreds to thousands of letters long in

the same way

whole functions of the body are decided

by the DNA code having its copy placed

inside each cell of the body this DNA

code is nearly three billion letters

long and its instructions are written by

different sequences and arrangements of

the four letters a T G and C a unique

combination of these letters instructs

the cell how to carry out extremely

complex body functions these four

letters of DNA code a tgc are actually

names of four chemicals these are

adenine thymine guanine and cytosine

that respectively stand for a T G and C

letters as 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 is

an example of a computer program

instruction in the binary language with

letters ones and zeroes similarly a G a

G t GG C T C AC t CC T G a a is an

example of an instruction in the DNA

code written by using four letters ATG

and C now remember the example of

message written on the beach again if

such a simple message written on the

beach cannot be written by chance or

randomly by CBS and needs an intelligent

mind conveying a piece of information

how is it possible to neglect an

infinitely intelligent superintelligence

who has written that incredibly long

dense and complex code of three billion

letters inside the nucleus of each cell

who placed that code there is it just by

chance do you know how much complex the

DNA code is the DNA code contains all

the information that makes up an

organism all the features that makes you

every quality and trait that you

possess every chemical reaction taking

place inside your body and lot more this

code is transferred to the next

generations that is the reason why a

child has many characteristics similar

to his or her parents it's interesting

to note that a child shares 99.5% of the

DNA with his parents everything that is

happening inside the cell is instructed

by the DNA code written in the language

of four letters a TG and C not only this

this code has instructions also for auto

repairing itself this three billion

letter code is copied to new cells

before a cell dies so the information is

not lost after the death of the cell

these all unbelievably complex functions

are performed by the DNA code at

extremely high speed without you even

noticing this 3 billion letter code is

so long that if a person types one word

per second for eight hours a day

continuously it would take him 50 years

to type the human genome that is the DNA

code and this code is not just about its

length the code has to instruct the cell

to complete highly complex tasks so it's

obvious that job to write this program

is beyond the limits of a human mind no

program has ever been written by chance

if you are a computer programmer then

you can understand how much intelligence

concentration creativity pain and time

it takes to write a simple code of just

few hundred words if we want to get a

task done by instructing a machine can

that computer program be written without

an intelligent programmer by itself by

chance

no so how can we think that this

incredibly long code of three billion

letters that is unbelievably complex and

the densest storage of information in

the universe can be written without any

super intelligence behind it who is that

programmer that must be no one other

than the god itself therefore

according to many scientists God has

shown its presents in the DNA code by

showing his infinite intelligence for

many researchers this is the proof of

God placed inside every cell of our body

watching this video see you soon in the

next video till then bye bye and take
