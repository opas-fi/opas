Infinite monkey theorem


The infinite monkey theorem says that an infinite number of monkeys sitting at an infinite number of typewriters randomly hitting keys, given enough time, will eventually reproduce the complete works of Shakespeare. 

"To be or not to be" 

How long do you think it will take the monkey to randomly hammer this out?

The quote has 18 characters (including space). The probability of the monkey typing 't' (let's be generous and say it's ok to be all small caps) is 1 out of 26. So the probability of typing the exact sequence 
"To be or not to be" is 1 out of 26 to the power of 18 or 1 out of about 29,479,510,200,013,920,000,000,000. If let's say the monkey type a letter every second, there is just 1 chance out of 934,789,136,225,707,600 years that it will type out that quote. 

That's 1 time in 934 trillion years.
