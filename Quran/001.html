    <h1>Al-Fatihah [The Opener]</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.</li>
        <li>All praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds,[1]</li>
        <ol>
            <li>[1] i.e., Lord of everything in existence including angels, humans, and animals.</li>
        </ol>
        <li> the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful,</li>
        <li>Master of the Day of Judgment.</li>
        <li>You ˹alone˺ we worship and You ˹alone˺ we ask for help.</li>
        <li>Guide us along the Straight Path,</li>
        <li>the Path of those You have blessed—not those You are displeased with, or those who are astray.[1]</li>
        <ol>
            <li>[1] It is customary to say “Âmîn” or “Amen” at the end of this sûrah.</li>
        </ol>
